# Project Structure Guide

This project is a Next.js app using the `/src` directory for all source code. Key structure:

// Prettier format rules
- Move the third party import at the top of the file, and leave space between different folder
  - Example:
  - import { useState } from 'react';
  -
  - import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

Follow Next.js app directory conventions. Use Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for styling. Supabase is the backend for auth, data, and storage.
