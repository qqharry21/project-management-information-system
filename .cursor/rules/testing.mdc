# Testing Guide

- Use Jest and React Testing Library for all unit and integration tests.
- Place test files next to the code under test, named `*.test.ts(x)`.
- Test all components, hooks, and utilities. Mock external dependencies (e.g., Supabase, network).
- Use `@testing-library/react` for UI, `@testing-library/jest-dom` for assertions.
- Prefer testing behavior and user interaction over implementation details.
- Use factories or fixtures for test data. Avoid hardcoding values in multiple tests.
- Run tests with `npm test` or `yarn test`. Add CI for automated test runs.
- 100% coverage is not required, but all critical logic and edge cases must be tested.
